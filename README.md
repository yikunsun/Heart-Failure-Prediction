# Kaggle Heart Failure Prediction
**Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. If healthcare workers are equipped with advanced tools to predict the survival of each patient, they can intervene earlier to help those patients who are in a serious condition to reduce the mortality rate.**

**In this project, I built 5 machine learning models to predict possible death of patients caused by heart failure. Models with accuracy on testing data are below:**

  **Logistic Regression: 86.67%**
  
  **KNN: 88.33%**
  
  **Decision Tree: 95%**
  
  **Random Forest: 93.33%**
  
  **XGBoost: 93.33%**
