# Kaggle Heart Failure Prediction
**Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. If healthcare workers are equipped with advanced tools to predict the survival of each patient, they can intervene earlier to help those patients who are in a serious condition to reduce the mortality rate.**

**In this project, I built several machine learning models to predict possible death of patients caused by heart failure.**
